They combine their faith, courage, and love to overcome an evil slayer who seeks to bring an end to dragon heritage, forever.<br></br>The kids at school call Billy \"Dragon Breath\" for good reason. His breath is bad! It isn't the normal, morning-mouth bad; it's the hot-as-fire, \"don't-you-dare-get-near-me\" bad. Trouble erupts when his hot breath sets off the fire sprinklers in the boys' restroom in school, and his parents learn that they've kept their secret for too long.<br></br>Billy finally discovers the secret. His father was once a dragon! Now that's a piece of news a guy doesn't deal with every day! Billy feels betrayed, alien, lost. When the dragon slayer traps him on a cold mountaintop in West Virginia, Billy learns to battle with weapons of steel and spirit while relying on a power he doesn't understand, a power that helps him learn to trust again.<br></br>Bonnie, an orphan, tries to find a home, someone to love her, even though she feels like a freak because of a body feature that she calls a deformity.

And what happened to The Candlestone, that strange gem, always absorbing light and with it the powers of dragons or dragon children within its sphere of influence?<br></br>The Candlestone not only absorbs light, it captures and holds encoded light, including transluminated humans, people who have been transformed into light energy by Excalibur, King Arthurâ€™s great sword.
